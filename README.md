     Challenge: Spend at least 30 minutes a day learning Linux.

I am going to be calling this a challenge. Really, it isn't much of a challenge. 30 minutes a day of learning is easy, in fact it should be a normal part of our lives. However, it hasn't been for me. It is currently December 2nd, 2024, and late last night (12/01/2024) 
I was thinking about what I can do to actually stick with my learning goals. In the past, I have told myself I will sit down every day and self study (topics outside of schoolwork) for 2-3 hours each day. Surprisingly enough, I stuck with this for about two weeks. I was
studying for my CompTIA Security+. However, as I am sure you can guess, studying 2-3 hours a day is not sustainable. 

Recently I was at a InfoSec conference, and during the lunch I was talking with the people sitting at my table. As I was the youngest (18) and newest to InfoSec (freshman in college), they were all giving me advice, regarding InfoSec but also life advice in general. 
Eventually, we got on the topic of self studying/daily learning. One of them mentioned that if you set a goal to, for example, do Hack The Box for two hours a day, you won't do it. However, if you set a goal so small where it seems almost easy to do (e.g. do Hack The Box
for 30 minutes a day) you will actually stay consistent and do it. 

I instantly understood what he was talking about. I remembered my goal to study for Security+ multiple hours a day, and that crashed and burned. However, I had never tried to make "small goals". So, after a bit of thought, this is that small goal I have came up with. 

Recently at my college's cybersecurity club meeting, they asked me to learn Linux and Linux Hardening to help them in a competition in early February. I jotted down what they said to learn (firewalld, selinux/apparmor, backups, smtp and scripting) and realized I could 
turn learning this into a smart goal. 

30 minutes a day, learning Linux. That is my smart goal. What if I am on vacation and forgot my laptop? No worries, watch a 30 minute YouTube video regarding Linux or listen to a podcast. As long as I spend 30 minutes a day doing SOMETHING regarding learning Linux 
(actively using Linux, messing with BASH, listening to a podcast, reading a book, etc) then I completed the goal for the day.

I find this to be much more sustainable. 30 minutes a day seems like nothing, and last night I thought about how I waste 30 minutes of time in the morning that I could easily replace with learning Linux. 

So, that is the backstory behind this challenge. The rules of this challenge are as follows:

1. Do something daily regarding learning Linux.
2. Do this thing for at least 30 minutes.
3. Journal/log your progress daily.
4. Don't be a lazy POS and not do it!!!!!

I believe these are very simple rules. I am not sure how long I will continue this challenge. Obviously, I have a bit of a deadline due to the competition, but I will reevaulate after that with how long I want to do this challenge. 

For now, I am focusing on Linux Mint. I will primarily be following a Udemy course (which I will put in the SOURCES file) and ChatGPT to generate some tasks for me to do. I will be doing a journal each day where I log what I did, what I learned, and how I feel on that 
day about the challenge.

This is the introduction to the challenge. Best of luck.
