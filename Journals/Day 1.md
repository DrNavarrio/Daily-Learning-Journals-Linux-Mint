I followed the ChatGPT prompt, and messed around first with the desktop, right clicking on it and looking at all the options and exploring them. I then moved on to the Files app and got a sense how that navigates. I like doing it on the command line more honestly. I used ls -l and read the man page, and used cd to navigate a few directories. I learned to use touch, that was cool because previously when I messed with it I somehow messed it up, even though it's literally such a simple command. I did touch test.txt, then cat test.txt to verify it was empty then removed it with rm test.txt.

Today was good. Toward the end I started hunting for a GUI view of my drives, like how Windows has the "This PC" button. I used ChatGPT to help me find it, it said that it should be under devices in Nemo but I wasn't able to find it. Maybe my drive isn't mounted? Still need to learn what mounting a drive means/does. 

Overall was a good day as I followed the ChatGPT prompt and learned a new command (touch).
