Today I finsihed the "Day 1" section of the Udemy course. The section is just a little bit over an hour. He was just showing the installation process more and how to access Linux from VM's. I know how to do that but still
watched it just so I can get the certificate of completion at the end of the course. Was a good day, excited to get into more of the hands on aspect tomorrow.
