Even though I am writing this a day late, I did not miss a day. I did 30 minutes yesterday just never got to journaling it. I started the Udemy course, and I watched the intro videos for that. It explained what Linux was,
it's history and it's uses. I knew most of that already but it was still a nice recap. I like the layout of the course so far. I am skipping the videos where it talks about how to install Linux, because I already know how to
do that. 

It was a good day today and I am glad I started the course.
