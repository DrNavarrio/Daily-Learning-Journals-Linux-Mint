For Day 1, start with getting familiar with your Linux Mint system and its layout:

Task: Explore the Linux Mint desktop environment and terminal. Spend time navigating through the file manager and settings to understand its layout.

Commands to practice in the terminal:

ls -l to see detailed file information.
man ls to learn how to read a manual page.
cd to navigate directories; explore /home, /var, /etc.
touch and rm to create and delete files in a test folder you create (e.g., mkdir test-folder).
Note-taking: Write down anything you discover, such as default directories, their purpose, and commands you use.

Let me know tomorrow when you're ready for the next step!
