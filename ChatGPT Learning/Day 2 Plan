Day 2: File Management and Permissions
Task: Learn about file permissions and practice managing them.

Open the terminal and navigate to the test folder you created on Day 1.
Run ls -l to review file permissions.
Commands to learn and practice:

chmod: Change file permissions.
Example: chmod 644 testfile or chmod +x script.sh.
chown: Change file ownership (use sudo to try it).
Example: sudo chown username:groupname testfile.
touch and mkdir: Create test files and directories to practice on.
rm -r: Remove directories.
Practical Exercise:

Create a file (touch testfile.txt).
Change its permissions to read-only for the owner and no access for others (chmod 400 testfile.txt).
Test editing or accessing it to see how permissions work.
Reset the permissions to normal (chmod 644 testfile.txt).
Note-taking:

Record the meaning of different permission numbers (e.g., 644, 755) and how rwx translates into numbers.
Let me know how it goes and if you're ready for Day 3!
